Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog along with Superman, disguised as Clark Kent, keep an eye on things from inside the museum. At the museum, Wonder Dog starts sneezing because he smelled almonds in the air, and while all the commotion was going on, the paintings went missing. Professor Baffles now threatens to steal a hefty shipment of $5 million in cash. The Justice League must now make sure the money shipment makes it to Hawaii. The Super Friends thwarted an attempted heist by a gang of crooks and safely got the shipment onto a ship. On the ship, the junior members run into Mr. Mergen, a man they met earlier at the library. Wendy starts having suspicions about Mr. Mergen and she, Marvin and Wonder Dog follow him. Meanwhile, the Super Friends decide to check on the money and find almond residue. They come to the conclusion that Professor Baffles made the money disappear with a chemical solution. The junior members catch up to Mr. Mergen to find out he is actually Professor Baffles. Professor Baffles reveals he is going to make humans non-corrupt again by making books, paintings, music, and other bad influences go away. Mr. Dabney and Mr. Darvey, the two brutes Professor Baffles works for, hold Professor Baffles captive as well after he refuses to have anything more to do with them.

Aquaman also decides to search Point Gander, the place where Hillbrandt was last seen, and finds Hillgrant's diving suit. Later, the Junior Super Friends end up meeting with Dr. Ansil Hillbrandt on his submarine The Sprite only to find out he faked his death and took to the sea where he has developed the ability to communicate with sea creatures and the technology that enables him to tap into the energies of underwater volcanoes in order to control hurricanes and tidal waves from within The Sprite. When the Super Friends thwart the plot and Superman brings The Sprite to the surface, Hillbrandt is persuaded to end his campaign when Hutchinson, Caraway, and Fenwick agree to cooperate.\n",

Dr. Shamon refuses to let the Junior Super Friends go or listen to his assistant Madam Lila LaBeau, causing Madam LaBeau to get the young heroes to safety.

Conveniently, Clark Kent has been given a television assignment on the Venus space probe in which he attends with Wendy and Marvin. Wonder Dog forgets his pass and stays outside, where he is confronted by a man who wants to take his picture. The man is actually Dr. Rebos, who is taking the picture so he can make an android double of Wonder Dog to infiltrate the space station and destroy the mission.

            "    The Super Friends are alerted when a mysterious red light shines on diamonds and then vanishes. Our heroes discover that in the process, the diamonds are stolen and are replaced by imitations. Dr. LaBond, a misguided scientist and his \"trusted\" assistant Wilbur, are stealing diamonds to power the Planet Splitter, an invention which LaBond has perfected for the purpose of splitting a planet and using half of it to serve as a second Moon with the hopes of providing Earth with more natural resources, but Wendy and Marvin point out that a second Moon would cause terrible weather conditions on Earth. Dr. LaBond is certain the project will work, and has targeted the planet Signus Uno. However, the Super Friends have placed a microdot homing signal on one of the stolen diamonds. The real thief turns out to be Wilbur, who wanted the diamonds so badly, that he made false reports to let Dr. LaBond think that his project would work, when it was really a doomed failure all along. The center portion of this episode tells the origin of Superman, as narrated by Marvin, in hopes of dissuading Dr. LaBond and Wilbur from proceeding with their plans.\n",

            "    The Super Friends close their first series by responding to ocean calamities when a mysterious red tide appears in the ocean that upsets the ecological balance of the sea. It is the work of Holo and Zara, a pair of water people from another planet who are trying to gather enough silicon to get their mother ship, inhabited by the rest of their people, home. The Super Friends are aided by Professor Matey and his submarine which is used as their base. The biggest highlight of the episode is watching the big swim chase in the ocean when Aquaman chases after Holo.\n",

After receiving a message on the Justice League TroubAlert, Superman and Wonder Woman confronts Captain Sinbad and his Space Pirate crew. Captain Sinbad then hurls city buildings toward a mountain range allowing the pirates to escape the two Super Friends. The Super Friends regroup to strategize and later streak off to confront the Space Pirates. While trying to stop a Space Pirate boat, Wonder Woman gets hit with a stun laser and taken captive aboard one of the ships. Meanwhile, at the Hall of Justice, the JLA satellite monitor picked up Wonder Woman, causing Zan to convince Jana to go after her. When Zan and Jana find Wonder Woman, they get trapped by the Space Pirates and a mind-controlled Wonder Woman and are made Sinbad's slaves. Wonder Woman then sends a warning to the other Super Friends to leave the Space Pirates alone or they may never see the Wonder Twins again. Superman then disguises himself as Clark Kent to enter the Space Pirates’ ship and rescue Wonder Woman and the Wonder Twins.\n",

Later Wonder Woman and Aquaman arrive in Transylvania after the Wonder Twins report it was taken over by bats, only to be attacked by dozens of mindless vampires. Another report of vampire attacks was made and this time Superman went to Vienna to stop them. While in Vienna, Superman runs into Dracula, who was continuing his plans of conquest, and gets turned into a vampire. Realizing Superman is under Dracula's control, the Wonder Twins attempt to stop the victimized Man of Steel. Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Batman, and Robin all escape the face of danger, only to find that Superman and the Wonder Twins have been turned into vampires and are turning nearly everyone else into vampires as well. The four Super Friends regroup at the Biological Research Center in Switzerland to find a way to reverse the effects the vampires have on people. They now must find a strange breed of South American bat in the Andes Mountains whose cave has gases that could reverse the vampire effect. It is now up to the Super Friends to transform the vampires back to normal and figure out a way to stop Dracula.\n",

The Super Friends then receive a distress call from the West Coast saying Death Valley is being overrun by giant desert beasts. Wonder Woman and the Wonder Twins stay behind to check the Justice League computer for more information, while the rest of the Super Friends head to Death Valley. At Death Valley they find wreckage and a man who says giant lizards had nearly destroyed the town. As Superman continues to search for the mysterious giant beasts, he stumbles upon some mutated giant earthworms that he must save some teens from. As Aquaman, Batman, and Robin fight the creatures that attacked them, Wonder Woman finds out what happened via the Justice League computer and heads to NASA for more information. As Wonder Woman approaches the location of the downed satellite, the radiation turns her into a giant beast. As the Wonder Twins try to stop Wonder Woman's destruction of a military base, the radiation genetically alters them into giant beasts. Meanwhile, giant earthworms are digging holes into California's coast, which will potentially sink. To save everyone, the Super Friends must stop the creatures and turn them and the \"Wonder\" heroes back to normal.\n",

After viewing a database containing information of how the members of the Legion of Doom originated and how they attempted to take over Earth, they later head to a ruined Hall of Doom. They also encounter a recording of an argument between each of the Legion's members. Grodd warns Luthor that even though they won, his latest plan also sealed their fate along with the Super Friends. The three extraterrestrials undo the destruction of Earth.\n",

He, with his assistant Orville Gump, hatch an elaborate plot to destroy the Super Friends. Luthor aligns himself with evil fire demons who originate from the Sun. They aid Luthor in capturing the Super Friends and placing them in death traps. The demons then change the color of the Sun from yellow to red, which cause Superman's powers to vanish. However, the Sun demons double-cross Luthor and he is trapped in a fire, so he has no choice but to free the Super Friends in an effort to save himself and Earth. The Super Friends perform rescues and put out the fires. Superman uses the Super-Mobile to chase the fire demons back into the Sun...which causes the Sun to return to its natural color...which restores Superman's powers.

Superman goes to California to stop the out of control train that is about to collide with another train. Shortly after, the Super Friends receive another TroubAlert that a cargo ship named the Queen Victoria is in the middle of a big storm and is about to be driven against some rocks. Wonder Woman takes Aquaman right to the ship in her thought-powered invisible jet, where he must find a way to anchor the powerless ship. While on their way to pick up Aquaman from the coast, Batman and Robin have to save two construction workers when an out of control crane puts their lives in danger. Meanwhile, Aquaman successfully anchors the ship with the help of some ocean creatures and regroups with Batman, Robin, Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog. There they meet a Special Inspector with Scotland Yard named Sir Cedric Cedric, who says the British ships have been targeted and he was looking for sabotage. Wonder Woman was patrolling the skies and noticed a leak in a dam that is about to cause a flood. To hold off the water, Wonder Woman makes an earth dam, but it springs a leak also, causing her to slam a boulder into it. The rest of the Super Friends join her and help stop the flood by closing the floodgates. On a stormy night, Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog check out an electrical generator plant and find a mysterious shadowy figure. The young heroes chase the mysterious figure, only to bump into Sir Cedric Cedric, who says the suspect had gotten away. The Super Friends must stop the power outage disasters with the help of Wendy providing details about the electrical generator plant, the shadowy figure out who calls himself the Power Pirate and how Sir Cedric fits into the picture.',\n",

The Super Friends stake out the American Museum. Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog along with Superman, disguised as Clark Kent, keep an eye on things from inside the museum. At the museum, Wonder Dog starts sneezing because he smelled almonds in the air, and while all the commotion was going on, the paintings went missing. Professor Baffles now threatens to steal a hefty shipment of $5 million in cash. The Justice League must now make sure the money shipment makes it to Hawaii. The Super Friends thwarted an attempted heist by a gang of crooks and safely got the shipment onto a ship. On the ship, the junior members run into Mr. Mergen, a man they met earlier at the library. Wendy starts having suspicions about Mr. Mergen and she, Marvin and Wonder Dog follow him. Meanwhile, the Super Friends decide to check on the money and find almond residue. They come to the conclusion that Professor Baffles made the money disappear with a chemical solution. The junior members catch up to Mr. Mergen to find out he is actually Professor Baffles. Professor Baffles reveals he is going to make humans non-corrupt again by making books, paintings, music, and other bad influences go away. Mr. Dabney and Mr. Darvey, the two brutes Professor Baffles works for, hold Professor Baffles captive as well after he refuses to have anything more to do with them. Wonder Dog escapes and warns the Super Friends that Wendy and Marvin need to be rescued.',\n",

Wonder Woman takes Aquaman right to the ship in her thought-powered invisible jet, where he must find a way to anchor the powerless ship. While on their way to pick up Aquaman from the coast, Batman and Robin have to save two construction workers when an out of control crane puts their lives in danger.

There they meet a Special Inspector with Scotland Yard named Sir Cedric Cedric, who says the British ships have been targeted and he was looking for sabotage.

On a stormy night, Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog check out an electrical generator plant and find a mysterious shadowy figure. The young heroes chase the mysterious figure, only to bump into Sir Cedric Cedric, who says the suspect had gotten away.

Darkseid hopes to exploit the princess, and to take sinister advantage of Superman\\'s weakened state!\\nThe Bizarro Super Powers Team: Bizarro #1, the weird yet funny Superman doppelganger from Htrae (Bizarro World), uses his duplicator ray to create Bizarro versions of Wonder Woman, Firestorm and Cyborg. These \"opposite clones\" are then called upon to protect Bizarro World from its many enemies. Unfortunately, the prankish Mr. Mxyzptlk plans to harness the powers of the three Bizarro superheroes in order to wreak havoc upon the earth, in an endless series of nasty pranks and practical jokes specially designed to drive everyone as crazy as HE is! Until the Real Wonder Woman uses the duplicator ray on Mr. Mxyzptlk to create Mr. Kltpzyxm, causing the Bizarro Super Powers team to go back to Bizarro World and stop him, and making Mr. Mxyzptlk accidentally say his name backwards and go back to the 5th dimension.',\n",

It's all part of a master plan to steal the deadly TC7 satellite and transform everyone on earth into hideous mutants. The Galactic Guardians set out to rescue the real Steve and thwart Darkseid—a task made doubly difficult when Wonder Woman herself is kidnapped!\",\n",
              "  '88': \"Gotham City is literally held in the grip of terror by The Scarecrow's arsenal of Fear Transmitters. Scouring Gotham in search of Scarecrow, Batman is himself paralyzed with fright when he finds himself in the middle of Crime Alley, where years earlier the parents of Batman's alter ego Bruce Wayne had been murdered in cold blood. Taking advantage of the situation, Scarecrow intends to keep Batman trapped in Crime Alley forever by using a captured Robin and Wonder Woman as bait—forcing the Caped Crusader to purge himself of his lifelong fears once and for all!  NOTE: This is the first time that the origin of Batman is told in any other media outside the comics.\",\n",
              "  '89': 'There\\'s a new supervillain in town, and his name is The Ace. Gathering together a gang of four hardened delinquents, the Ace decks them out in sinister playing-card costumes, and thus the Royal Flush Gang is born. In their efforts to defeat this scurrilous quintet of no-goods, Robin and Cyborg discover that the Ace is taking his orders directly from their perennial enemy Darkseid—while Batman learns to his astonishment that the Ace is not a \"new\" nemesis at all, but instead a very old one... The Joker!  NOTE: The Joker makes his first and only appearance in the Super Friends franchise in this episode.',\n",

To save the life of his fellow Galactic Guardian, Firestorm enlists the aid of Superman and rushes to Cyborg\\'s rescue. But it may already be too late: The two superpowered good guys are confronted by a gigantic killer robot... with Cyborg\\'s brain and intellect trapped inside its power source! NOTE: Green Lantern makes a cameo appearance.\\nThe Case of the Stolen Powers: While languishing in prison with the Penguin as his cellmate, evil necromancer Felix Faust conjures up a spell which enables him to steal the special powers of Superman. No sooner has this happened than the Penguin appropriates these powers for himself, and as result the Super Powers Team now works for him! In order to thwart the Penguin and emerge as the real villain of the piece, Faust absorbs all of Superman\\'s powers, but Firestorm creates a kryptonite crown on Faust\\'s head, weakening him and Wonder Woman uses her Magic Lasso to force him to give up Superman\\'s powers and return them to the man of steel!\\nNOTE: First appearance of Felix Faust and The Penguin. Curiously, Batman and Robin were not present to face The Penguin. Aquaman, Hawkman, and Samurai cameo appearances.',\n",
